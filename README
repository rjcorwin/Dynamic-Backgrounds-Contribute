A workflow allows users to submit Background nodes and let Administrators approve them.

This module depends on https://github.com/zorphas/Dynamic-Backgrounds

== What this includes ==

This feature module includes the Background content type, 1 View (dynamic_backgrounds_contribute) with 2 Views Page Displays for un/publishing Background nodes, and two Views Block Displays for users to view their own un/published Background nodes. You can publish submitted (queued) Background nodes by going to Administer > Site Configuration > Dynamic Background - Queued.  You can review published Background nodes by going to Administer > Site Configuration > Dynamic Background - Published.  This workflow depends on the Override Node Options module which provides role based permissions to the Publish field per content type. I believe the Feature contains the correct permission configuration but a permission review will need to take place before launch.
